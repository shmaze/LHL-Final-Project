# LHL-Final-Project
Final Data Science Project for Lighthouse Labs

#### Goals and Aims of this Project
For my final Data Science project at Lighthouse Labs I wanted to create a model that predicts the direction of price movement for Bitcoin. 
I will be using the trading pair BTC/USDT and attempting to use different machine learning classification techniques to determine which type of trading position to open. I will be training this model to attempt to predict whether to open a long trading position (when the price is predicted to rise) or a short trading postiion (when the price is predicted to fall). If this model can predict with an accuracy above 55% it should be able to consistently generate profitable trading positions.
